But how do you use EvoScan V2.6 to log your car? It's simple. All you need is a laptop, a USB cable and the EvoScan software. You can download the software from https://evoscan.com/[^1^] and install it on your laptop. Then, you need to connect your laptop to the car via the OBD2 port under the steering wheel. If you have a Tactrix OpenPort 2.0 cable, you can use either the black or the green connector[^4^]. If you have another cable, you may need to use a specific connector depending on your vehicle model[^2^]. Once you have connected the cable, you can launch EvoScan and select your vehicle settings from the menu. You can also customize the parameters you want to log and display on the screen. Then, you can start logging by clicking on the Start button or pressing F9 on your keyboard[^4^]. You can also save your logs as CSV files for later analysis.
 
EvoScan V2.6 also allows you to reflash your ECU with modified maps to improve performance and fuel economy. You can use EcuFlash, a free software that works with EvoScan, to edit and flash your ECU maps. You can download EcuFlash from https://www.tactrix.com/index.php?option=com\_content&view=article&id=48&Itemid=60[^3^] and install it on your laptop. Then, you need to connect your laptop to the car via the green connector of the Tactrix OpenPort 2.0 cable[^3^]. You can also use a battery charger or jumper cables to maintain a stable voltage during the flashing process. Once you have connected the cable, you can launch EcuFlash and read your ECU map by clicking on Read from ECU button or pressing Ctrl+R on your keyboard[^3^]. You can then edit your map using EcuFlash or another software like RomRaider or ECUedit. You can also use Map Tracer, a feature of EvoScan that allows you to directly edit and flash your map without using another software[^1^]. When you are done editing your map, you can flash it back to your ECU by clicking on Write to ECU button or pressing Ctrl+W on your keyboard[^3^]. You should always make a backup of your original map before flashing a modified one.
 
With EvoScan V2.6 and EcuFlash, you can unleash the full potential of your Mitsubishi Lancer Evo or Subaru. You can fine-tune your engine parameters, optimize your fuel consumption, increase your horsepower and torque, and enhance your driving experience. You can also diagnose and clear any trouble codes that may affect your engine performance. EvoScan V2.6 is a powerful software that every Lancer Evo or Subaru owner should have.

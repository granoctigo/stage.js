Ballast der Republik is a double album that consists of 16 new songs and a bonus disc with cover versions of German classics. The title translates to "Ballast of the Republic" and refers to the burden of history and politics that Germany carries. The album deals with topics such as nostalgia, love, Europe, freedom and rebellion.
 
The album opens with "Drei Kreuze (Dass wir hier sind)", a song that expresses gratitude for being alive and making music despite all the difficulties. The title track "Ballast der Republik" is a fast-paced punk anthem that criticizes the corruption and hypocrisy of the political system. "Tage wie diese" is one of the most popular songs on the album and a celebration of friendship and life. It became a huge hit in Germany and other countries and was sung by thousands of fans at concerts and festivals.
 
Other highlights on the album include "Altes Fieber", a catchy song about rekindling old passions; "Europa", a sarcastic commentary on the European Union; "Das ist der Moment", a motivational song about seizing the day; and "Vogelfrei", a powerful ballad about being an outcast.
 
The bonus disc, titled Die Geister, die wir riefen ("The Spirits That We Summoned"), features 15 cover versions of songs by German artists that influenced Die Toten Hosen or were part of their musical upbringing. The selection ranges from rock legends like Udo Lindenberg and Herbert GrÃ¶nemeyer to punk pioneers like Fehlfarben and Ton Steine Scherben to pop icons like Nena and Falco. The covers are respectful but also playful and creative, showing Die Toten Hosen's versatility and sense of humor.
